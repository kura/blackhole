.. _contributing:

Contributing
============

If you're thinking about contributing, it's really quite simple. There is no
need to feel daunted. You can contribute in a variety of ways:

- `Report bugs <https://github.com/kura/blackhole/issues>`_,
- `fix bugs <https://github.com/kura/blackhole/issues>`_,
- `add new behaviour <https://kura.gg/blackhole/todo.html>`_,
- `improve the documentation
  <https://github.com/kura/blackhole/tree/master/docs/source>`_,
- `write tests <https://github.com/kura/blackhole/tree/master/tests>`_,
- improve performance, and
- add additional support i.e. new versions of Python or PyPy.

Please make sure that you read, understand and accept the `Code of Conduct
<https://github.com/kura/blackhole/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.rst>`__.

You can view a list of tasks that need work on the :ref:`todo` page.

The :ref:`api` section also has a wealth of information on how the server works
and how you can modify it or use parts of it.

Getting started
---------------

Getting started is very similar to installing blackhole yourself. You should
familarise yourself with the documentation,
`PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ Python style guide and
`PEP257 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_ docstring conventions.

Writing some code
-----------------

You'll need to fork the blackhole repository and checkout the source to your
machine, much like any other project.

You'll need to create a new branch for each piece of work you wish to do.

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b branch_name

Once this is done, you need to run setup.py with the `develop` argument instead
of `install`.

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py develop

Now you can hackaway.

Things to do before submitting a pull request
---------------------------------------------

- Make sure that you've written tests for what you have changed, or at least
  try to.
- Add your name to the CONTRIBUTORS list, feel free to add a comment about what
  you did i.e. `Kura added STARTTLS support`.
- Submit your pull request.

.. _testing:

Running tests
-------------

You can find the latest tests against the source code on `GitHub <https://github.com/kura/blackhole/actions/workflows/ci.yml>`_.

Running tests manually is pretty simple, there is a `Makefile` target dedicated
to it.

The test suite relies on `py.test <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/>`_ and is
installed via the `Makefile` target and the `setup.py test` target.

The test suite takes a while to run, there are a lot of parts that require
communication and also use calls :any:`asyncio.sleep`, which cause the test
suite to pause until the sleep is done.

.. code-block:: bash

    make test

To use the `setup.py test` target.

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py test

You can also test using `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_,
when run through the `Makefile` `tox` will be installed automatically and the
tests will be parallelised.

.. code-block:: bash

    make tox

Building the documentation
--------------------------

The Makefile supplied also has a target for building the documentation.

.. code-block:: bash

    make docs
